**Lesson Overview:**  
In this lesson, we will learn how to access the different components of the Android system such as the camera, location, and sensors. These can be incorporated in any apps to add more features in addition to apps that are built entirely on these components.  

**Use Case Description:**  
**Android Hardware:** Maps, Camera, Audio, Storage  

**Programming Elements:**  
Accessing the different hardware components of the Android system(location, camera, microphone, Accelerometer, Gyroscope)  

We have provided most of the code and you can update the given source code to complete the ICP. However, don't limit yourself to given example screens and you canbe more creative.
