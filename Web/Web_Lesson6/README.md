This repo contains all materials covered in Web Lesson 6:  

There is no limit on details and creativity. You can add as many details as you can and create an attractive and interactive web page. 
1. Create an application in Angular which displays nearby restaurants (Hint: Use Foursquare API)
2. Create an application in Angular which displays recipes (Hint: Use EDAMAM API)
If possible, combine both the APIs in a single application. (Given starter code has both together. Change the UI if you are going to use this code)
Note:You must use the Angular (not the AngularJS)
