## Hover Image
Code Reference: https://codepen.io/saisrinarne/pen/RwbZdyy  

Look at the Image I and Image II for reference. When the user mouse hovers on the image, it should change the background of the empty frame with relevant images and text. For example, when the mouse hovered on the first image in Image I, it should change the contents (both background-image and text) of the empty frame, as shown in Image II.
Note: We have provided basic (HTML and CSS) code, you need to write JavaScript code
